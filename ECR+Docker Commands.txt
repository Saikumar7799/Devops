					How to Push Docker image into Amazon ECR

What are we going to do in this lab?
       1. Create an IAM role with ContainerRegistryFullAccess
       2. Create EC2 insatnce(ubuntu) and attach the created IAM role (Install Docker in this machine. 
       3. Create one Repository in AWS ECR
       4. Download pythonApp from Bitbucket.
       5. Build docker image for the Python App
       6. Push docker image to ECR
       7. Run python app in Docker container

Pre-requistes:
       *EC2 instance up and running with Docker installed
       *Make sure you open port 8081 (Security Group)
       *Install aws cli

@Create one ubuntu machine with attached IAM role.
1)EC2 instance up and running with Docker installed (Commands to install docker ubuntu machine):
   $curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh( this will download shell script in the machine)

   >Run the docker file
   $sh get-docker.sh  ( This will execute the shell script, which will install docker )

   >To check the docker is installed or not
   $docker --version

   >To download a docker image 
   $docker pull image name (Image name can get from hub.docker.com)

2)Create one Repository in AWS ECR.
    >Go to Elastic container registry and create one Repository and enter the details.
    >Once repo is created, choose the repo and click on view push commands. Note down the account ID.
    
3)Installing aws cli on ubuntu machine
    >Go to AWS console and search for ECR
    >Click on Create Repository
    >Enter name for your repo - all lower case and Click create repository
    >Once repo is created, choose the repo and click on view push commands. Note down the account ID
    >Copy the first command to install AWS cli 
   $sudo apt install awscli -y
    >Once AWS CLI is installed, you can verify the installation:
    $aws --version

4)Now login to AWS ECR using cli (After using below command you will get 
    $aws ecrget-login-password --region (your_region) | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin (your_ account_ID).dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  
5)Now let's build a docker image, I have already created a public repo in Bitbucket. All you need to do is perform the command below to clone my repo:
    $git clone https://bitbucket.org/ananthkannan/mydockerrepo; cd mydockerrepo/pythonApp

6)Run the command which builds a docker image.
    $ docker build . -t mypythonapp 

7)Now tag Docker image you had build
    $ docker tag mypythonapp:latest your_account_id.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/docker:latest

8)Now push the image into your ECR repository 
    $docker push your_acc_id.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/your-ecr-repo-name:latest

9)To run a Docker container from Docker image.
    $ docker run --name myDockerApp -p 8082:8081 -d mypythonapp
    >MyDockerApp is the app name (Enter any name as your wish )
    >mypythonappis the image name we downloaded from bitbucket (git repository)
